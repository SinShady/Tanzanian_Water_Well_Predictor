# Background

Tanzania is a developing country in East Africa, and is home to the tallest mountain on the continent.  Due to it's geographical location, many citizens are forced to walk three to miles round trip a day on order to acquire water, which is not even guaranteed to be safe for consumption.  This lack of access to drinkable water, combined with inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene leads to a very serious health crisis in which charity organizations are doing their best to combat.

# Tanzanian Water Well Challenge

Through a collaboration from Taarifa, a rwandan news platform, and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, the competition 'Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table' has been hosted.
